# API-Search-Books
I have one file with the name books.csv. 
The CSV file contains the general information about the books, like book name, author, year of publication, etc.
Here I developed two API endpoints.
1. Takes the row number as an input and displays respective number of book details rows
2. Takes JSON request with the column name and its value. Filter the data accordingly.

Implementation.
1. Install the required packages
2. I have used the OOP approach.
3. app.py is the main script with the driver code
4. books.py has the actual logic implementation.
5. run.py has the script to make the JSON request to the API.
5. Postman or curl can also be used to post the JSON request to the API
